# Back-end social media(work in progress!)

This is the back-end side of a project started with other volunteers. We are building a social-media style channel of communication for around 4000 
people to use.
The front-end side will utilise React.js to complete the application.

I am practicing: 
- Firebase Functions
- Firebase Auth
- Firebase Database
- Node.js
- Express
- Postman
- REST APIs
- React.js
- Material UI
